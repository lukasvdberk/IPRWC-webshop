# IPRWC-webshop
This is a website for class I had to take where we learned Angular and had to make
a small webshop. The theme for this webshop is t-shirts for the artist Scarlxrd.

The project currently runs [here](https://iprwc.lukas.sh/)
(there is a high chance I have taken it down if you read this)

### Installation
You need to have docker-compose installed then simply fill copy the .example-env
to the same folder and rename it .env. After that fill the .env with propper information.

When that is all done just run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```

After the front-end is build (you can see that in the console) you can visit http://localhost:4200 for development.
